Notes for deployment pipelines.
Current pipeline is using SFTP credentials.
If they ever need changing log into the relevant Azure instance > App Services > Deployment Center > FTPS credentials > Manage publish profile
Then download the publish profile and use that to replace the info in the relevant secret.
